# garage

A terminal UI for V8 engineers to view, navigate, search, and diff `d8`
trace output — Maglev graphs first, plus TurboFan/Turboshaft graphs,
Turbolev, optimized-code disassembly and bytecode listings — without
dumping megabytes into scrollback or switching to browser tools. The tool
`--print-maglev-graphs | less` should have been.

```
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --trace-deopt bench.js | garage
garage trace.log
```

Opens a 490 MB trace in ~0.5 s. Sections are indexed on load; compilations
parse lazily on first view; nothing is ever dropped — anything the parser does
not recognise stays visible as raw text with an `[unparsed]` badge.

## Install

```sh
cargo build --release        # rustc 1.85+, single static binary
cp target/release/garage ~/bin/
```

## Getting a useful trace

```sh
# The MVP invocation:
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --trace-deopt bench.js | garage

# Cleaner, diffable traces (recommended for graph work):
d8 --no-concurrent-recompilation --predictable \
   --print-maglev-graphs bench.js | garage

# Richer deopt frames (register → node → location):
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --print-maglev-deopt-verbose bench.js | garage

# Turbolev-frontend graphs (Maglev IR in the TurboFan pipeline):
d8 --turbolev --print-turbolev-frontend bench.js | garage

# TurboFan / Turboshaft pipeline graphs, schedules and instruction sequences:
d8 --trace-turbo-graph bench.js | garage

# Optimized-code disassembly and interpreter bytecode:
d8 --print-opt-code bench.js | garage      # needs v8_enable_disassembler
d8 --print-bytecode bench.js | garage

# Graphs *and* the assembly they became — the code dump printed right after
# a pipeline shows up as that compilation's last phases:
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --print-opt-code bench.js | garage
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --print-maglev-code bench.js | garage

# Tiering + OSR story alongside the graphs:
d8 --print-maglev-graphs --trace-opt --trace-deopt --trace-osr app.js | garage
```

Notes that save an afternoon:

- `--print-maglev-graphs` and friends exist only in builds with
  `V8_ENABLE_MAGLEV_GRAPH_PRINTER` (on by default in `debug`; check your GN
  args otherwise). Without it they silently print nothing.
- `--print-opt-code` additionally needs `v8_enable_disassembler = true`.
- `--trace-deopt-verbose` *implies* `--print-maglev-deopt-verbose` and changes
  the graph output as a side effect — flag implications are real.
- Use `--no-trace-with-compilation-id` when you want two runs to be
  comparable; it strips the volatile `[ML:<id>]` prefixes.
- With concurrent recompilation on (the default), output from several threads
  interleaves; garage degrades the un-demultiplexable parts to raw sections.
  `--no-concurrent-recompilation --predictable` avoids that entirely.

## Timeline & commands

`Tab` swaps the sidebar for the **timeline**: every `--trace-opt` /
`--trace-deopt` / `--trace-osr` event in stream order, colour-coded by
severity (deopts red, completions green, OSR yellow). Selecting a deopt shows
its whole bailout block — under `--trace-deopt-verbose` that is the full
frame-unwinding dump, styled — and `Enter` jumps to the correlated
compilation at the deopt's bytecode offset, per the `(SFI, tier, ordinal)`
rule in `docs/correlation-keys.md`. Events that cannot be resolved honestly
(no graph in the trace, Turbofan-only deopts) say so instead of guessing.

`:` opens the command palette (Tab completes, the status line shows live
candidates):

| Command | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| `:deopts` | timeline, narrowed to deopt events, with a count |
| `:checks` | lens: only guard nodes (`Check*`/`Assert*`/`*Deopt*`), counted |
| `:phi` | lens: the control/phi backbone of the graph |
| `:spill` | lens: regalloc spill/reload traffic |
| `:megamorphic` | lens: megamorphic feedback and slow-path ICs |
| `:function <re>` | filter the sidebar (same as `f`) |
| `:copy`, `:export <file>` | clipboard / Markdown export |
| `:clear` | drop the lens and the timeline narrowing |

A lens filters the modeled view down to the banner/block skeleton plus
matching lines; any jump whose target a lens hides clears the lens rather
than failing.

## Splits & the phase diff

`v`/`s` split the viewport; each pane has its own section selection (the
sidebar drives the focused pane, `Ctrl+W` switches), and the same key closes
the split again.

`d` is the reason splits exist. On a phase row it diffs that phase against
the previous graph phase; on a compilation it diffs the first graph phase
against the last; with a split already open it diffs whatever graph phases
the two panes show — including phases of *different* compilations of the
same function. The diff is **node-identity based**, never a raw text diff:

- nodes match by their `nN` id within a compilation (V8 preserves it across
  phases), or by structural hash (opcode + canonically renumbered inputs)
  across compilations;
- registers, schedule ids, live ranges and `, N uses` decorations do not
  count as changes — a node is `~ changed` only when its opcode or its
  actual inputs changed;
- `nA: Identity [nB]` replacements render as `→ n5 replaced by n12`, and a
  consumer whose inputs merely followed such a replacement is reported as
  "rerouted via Identity", not as a real input change;
- a node that moved blocks is `≈ moved`, not deleted-and-added;
- non-node lines fall back to a canonicalized text diff (addresses, `[ML:…]`
  ids and timings masked).

The two columns are row-aligned (scrolling is synced by construction), the
gutter and row tint encode the status (`+` `−` `~` `→` `≈`), the status line
shows the summary counts and the story of the row under the cursor, and
`Y`/`E` export the aligned view with its gutters.

The mouse works too: the wheel scrolls the pane under the pointer, and a
left click focuses a pane and places the selection or cursor — clicking a
node line lights up its def-use highlighting. Mouse capture takes over the
terminal's own text selection; use Shift-drag (Option-drag in Terminal.app)
for native selection, or `y`/`Y`/`E` to copy through garage itself.

Every binding is remappable in `~/.config/garage/config.toml` (or
`--config <path>`):

```toml
[keys]
quit = ["x"]              # frees q
half-page-down = "Ctrl+f"
```

A key bound to two actions is a startup error, and a config typo is a normal
error message — the alternate screen only opens once the config is valid.

## Bytecode arrays & feedback vectors

Maglev prints the bytecode array and the feedback vector ahead of every
graph, and `--print-bytecode` emits the same rows for Ignition; garage
parses them rather than dimming them. Rows are styled like graph nodes
(mnemonic by shape, jumps blue, constants magenta), feedback-slot headers
colour by IC state — MEGAMORPHIC red, POLYMORPHIC yellow, MONOMORPHIC
green — and the `:megamorphic` lens counts them.

The def-use chain works here the way it does in a graph. On a bytecode
row, `i` cycles through what its operands reference: the jump target
(`(0x… @ N)` suffixes and switch `{ 0: @44, … }` tables), each `FBV[n]`
slot in the feedback vector below, each `[n:…]` constant-pool entry.
On a slot, pool entry, or jump-target row, `u` cycles the rows that
reference it. The cursor highlights the same links in place, and
`Ctrl+O` unwinds any jump. (Bare `[n]` operands are immediates and
`EmbeddedFeedback[n]` is not a vector slot — neither pretends to
navigate.)

## Assembly as part of the pipeline

A code dump printed right after the pipeline that produced it merges into
that compilation — both the `--print-opt-code` form (`--- Optimized code
---`) and the bare `0x…: [Code]` object print of `--print-maglev-code` /
`--print-code` — `Raw source`,
`Optimized code`, `Instructions`, … appear as its last phases, so one
sidebar entry tells the whole story from bytecode to machine code. The
merge follows the no-guessing rule: sections must be line-adjacent and
agree on tier and name; anything else stays separate.

The `Raw source` block renders as JavaScript — keywords, strings,
numbers and comments styled by a small JS tokenizer, identifiers left
plain.

Inside the listing, branch targets are resolved from what V8 printed —
arm64's `(addr 0x…)` and x64's `<+0x…>` both — and their destination rows
get their offset column labelled: those are the de-facto basic blocks.
`[`/`]` walk them, `i` on a branch jumps to its destination, `u` on a
destination cycles the branches that land on it, and the cursor lights up
the link in both directions — the same def-use navigation graphs and
bytecode listings have.

## Dual-run comparison

Load two traces (`garage a.log b.log`) and the telemetry bar shows both
runs' headline numbers side by side. `D` on a compilation diffs it
against the same function in the other run — matched by name and tier
(SFI addresses are not comparable across runs; nodes match by structural
hash, as in any cross-compilation diff). On a phase row the same-named
phase is preferred on the other side; otherwise both sides use their
last graph phase — which is also what makes cross-*version* comparisons
work when V8 renamed the banners. The active run is always the right
pane; `d` (or `D`) drops back out.

## Source alignment

`S` opens the **source pane**: the compilation's script, resolved from the
path V8 printed — as-is, relative to the trace file's directory, or one
directory up (where `d8` usually ran). When no file resolves, the
compilation's own `Raw source` block stands in, aligned through the code
dump's `source_position`; when neither exists the status line says so.

Alignment runs on two grains, honestly labelled by what the trace
contains: `NNN S>` bytecode markers give per-row character positions
(interleaved graph rows inherit them through their bytecode offset), and
SFI context lines give per-function anchors as the fallback. The trace
cursor keeps its source line highlighted and centred; `Ctrl+W` (or `l`)
focuses the pane, parks its cursor on that line, and `Enter` cycles
through the trace rows aligned with the line under the cursor —
`Ctrl+O` unwinds, as everywhere.

## What the UI shows

- **Telemetry bar** — compilations per tier, OSR count, deopt count, detected
  V8 version (inferred from the phase-banner vocabulary).
- **Sidebar** — compilations (`name · tier · #ordinal`, OSR and `[unparsed]`
  badges) interleaved with raw sections, chronological or grouped by function
  (grouped mode keys on the SFI address, so an empty function name is fine).
- **Viewport** — the trace itself, styled from the parse: guards red, control
  flow blue, constants magenta, phis yellow, interleaved source bytecode dim.
  The box-drawing gutter that draws block edges gets its own colour per
  column — an edge keeps one colour for its whole length, and neighbouring
  edges differ — independent of what the rows it crosses contain.
  The cursor node's definition, inputs, and consumers highlight in distinct
  colours; deopt frames show which registers hold which nodes.

## CLI

```
garage [FILE...]              files (mmapped; several files = } to switch)
garage a.log b.log            dual-run comparison (D diffs a function)
d8 ... | garage               piped stdin; keyboard input still works
garage -- d8 ... bench.js     wrapper mode: spawn d8, stream it live
garage --function '^process'  index-time prefilter on function names
garage --debug                write diagnostics to garage.log (--log-file)
```

Wrapper mode owns the child: stdout and stderr merge in arrival order
(the interleaving a terminal would show), a non-zero exit lands as a
visible note at the end of the trace, quitting garage terminates the
child, and SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP restore the terminal before dying.

## Development

Real `d8` output is checked in under `fixtures/` (three builds: two V8
versions × two architectures) and every parser change runs against it:

```sh
cargo test                          # unit + golden + fuzz tests
UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test --test golden   # after an intentional change
git diff tests/golden/              # review exactly what changed
```

`docs/` has the design records: `spike-findings.md` (measured V8 output
behaviour the parsers encode), `printer-parser-contract.md` (which V8 source
prints what), `correlation-keys.md` (how deopt events map to compilations).
`PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` carry the design and the phase history.

Verified on macOS (Terminal.app/tmux, 80×24 up to full screen, 16 and 256
colour). Linux and SSH are expected to work but not yet measured — the fd-0
terminal handling in `src/tty.rs` documents the one platform-specific piece.
