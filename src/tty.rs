//! Getting a working keyboard when stdin is the data pipe.
//!
//! `d8 --print-maglev-graphs x.js | garage` is the primary invocation in
//! PLAN §9. In it stdin carries the trace, not keystrokes, so the keyboard has
//! to come from the controlling terminal instead. crossterm nominally handles
//! this — its unix event source opens `/dev/tty` when `isatty(0)` is false —
//! but on macOS that fallback does not work, and the failure is silent.
//!
//! ## Why `/dev/tty` is not enough on macOS
//!
//! crossterm's event source registers its input descriptor with `mio`, which is
//! `kqueue` on darwin. A descriptor obtained by opening `/dev/tty` cannot be
//! registered: `kevent` rejects it with `EINVAL`. Measured, in tmux:
//!
//! ```text
//! register(fd 0, a pty slave)      -> OK
//! register(open("/dev/tty"))       -> Err(EINVAL)      <-- crossterm's fallback
//! register(open("/dev/ttys003"))   -> OK               <-- the same terminal
//! ```
//!
//! `/dev/tty` is a clone device that resolves to the controlling terminal at
//! open time, and kqueue will not watch it. Note also that `ttyname()` on such
//! a descriptor answers `/dev/tty` rather than the underlying device, so the
//! name cannot be recovered from the descriptor itself. And `dup2`-ing it onto
//! fd 0 does not help: the rejection follows the open file description, not the
//! descriptor number.
//!
//! crossterm swallows the resulting error (`source.ok()`), so every later
//! `poll` returns "Failed to initialize input reader" and the UI simply never
//! receives a key. Worse, `crossterm::cursor::position` retries on error with
//! no backoff and no attempt limit, so anything that asks for the cursor
//! position — including `ratatui`'s `Terminal::clear` — spins at 100% CPU
//! forever.
//!
//! ## The fix
//!
//! `stdout` and `stderr` still point at the terminal even when stdin is a pipe,
//! and *their* descriptors refer to the pty slave directly. So: ask `ttyname`
//! for the real device path, open that, and `dup2` it onto fd 0. crossterm's
//! `isatty(0)` check then takes the path that works, with no patching of
//! crossterm required. The original stdin is duplicated out of the way first
//! and handed back for the reader thread to consume.
//!
//! This costs nothing on Linux, where `/dev/tty` would have worked anyway, and
//! keeps one code path rather than two.
