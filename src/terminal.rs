//! Terminal lifecycle.
//!
//! Raw mode and the alternate screen are process-global side effects on the
//! user's terminal. Leaving them set is the classic way a TUI ruins a shell
//! session, so restoration has to survive every exit path — clean return,
//! error return, and panic.
//!
//! Drop alone is not enough for the panic case: the panic hook runs *before*
//! unwinding, so without a hook the panic message is printed into the alternate
//! screen and then vanishes with it. Hence a hook that restores first and then
//! delegates to the default one, plus an idempotent `restore` so the guard's
//! Drop during unwinding is a no-op.
